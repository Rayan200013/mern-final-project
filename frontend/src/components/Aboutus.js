                Our company was born from the shared love of travel among three
                friends who first crossed paths at Park Innovation.
              </p>
              <p>
                After spending months navigating the corporate world, the
                decision was clear â€” to follow our hearts and create our very
                own travel company.
              </p>
              <p>
                Travel is more than a passion; it's a transformative experience
                that leaves an indelible mark on our lives. We embarked on this
                journey to help you uncover the magic of exploration, just as we
                did.
